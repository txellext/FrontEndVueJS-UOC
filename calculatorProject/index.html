        <p> Let's create an app that request 2 numbers (num1 i num2) inside a rang number of 1 to 50 and print:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summ both numbers.</li>
            <li>Show if both two numbers are prime numbers, else show that they are not prime both or one of them.
            </li>
            <li>Show if both numbers are even, else show that they are not even both or one of them. </li>
            <li>If num1 is less than num2, print only even numbers between num1 and num2 rang in an ascendent way. </li>
            <li>If num2 is bigger than num2, print only odd numbers between num1 and num2 rang in an descendant way. </li>
            <li>If num1 is equal to num2, print only one number. If its prime and if it is even only print the same number. </li>
            <li>If numbers doesn't meet any of before requirements, you should notify it to the user. </li>
        </ul>
