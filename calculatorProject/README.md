## Introduction 

Let's create a index.html where you will code the exercise, a Calculator app. 
If you want to request a numbers to the user you will use the promt() function of JS. 

<br>

### Tasks

Let's create an app that request 2 numbers (num1 i num2) inside a rang number of 1 to 50 and print:
-  Summ both numbers.
  
-  Show if both two numbers are prime numbers, else show that they are not prime both or one of them.

-  Show if both numbers are even, else shpw that they are not even both or one of them. 
  
-  If num1 is less than num2, print only even numbers between num1 and num2 rang in an ascendent way. 
  
-  If num2 is bigger than num2, print only odd numbers between num1 and num2 rang in an descendant way. 
  
-  If num1 is equal to num2, print only one number. If its prime and if it is even only print the same number. 
  
-  If numbers doesn't meet any of before requirements, you should notify it to the user.
